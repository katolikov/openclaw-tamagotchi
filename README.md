# openclaw-tamagotchi

A desktop pet that lives on top of every other window. Inspired by the
[OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) project (an open-source
re-implementation of *Capt. Claw*) and the visual style of
[codex-pets.net](https://codex-pets.net/).

The pet idles, walks around the bottom of your screen, sleeps when tired,
gets hungry, complains in speech bubbles, lets you drag it anywhere, and
remembers how it was feeling the last time you quit.

| | Pet | Personality | Run with |
| :---: | --- | --- | --- |
| <img src="docs/pet-claw.gif" alt="Claw" width="120">        | **Claw** — pirate cat                 | dreamy, nostalgic, gently chaotic     | `tamagotchi --pet claw`      |
| <img src="docs/pet-rabbit.gif" alt="Shamil" width="120">    | **Shamil** — brown bunny with tall ears | bouncy, snack-obsessed, ears for days | `tamagotchi --pet rabbit`    |
| <img src="docs/pet-dachshund.gif" alt="Alegra" width="120"> | **Alegra** — black-and-tan dachshund  | long girl, slow brain, expert napper  | `tamagotchi --pet dachshund` |

Each pet has its own sprite art, its own `pet.yaml` (different walk speed,
sleep timer, hunger curve), and its own dialogue book — so they actually
*feel* different running around your screen, not just look different.

> Want your own creature? See [HOWTO.md → Adding your own pet](HOWTO.md#adding-your-own-pet).
> The whole pet is just a folder.

## Features

- **Frameless, transparent, always-on-top window** — no taskbar entry, no dock icon (macOS optional)
- **State machine** — idle ↔ walk ↔ sleep, driven by stats and timers
- **Hunger / energy / happiness** stats that decay over time and trigger moods
- **Speech bubbles** that fade in and out above the pet's head, picked from a
  state- and mood-keyed dialogue book (mood overrides: `hungry`, `tired`, `sad`)
- **Drag the pet** anywhere on screen with the mouse; **click** to give it
  attention (♥ +5 happiness)
- **Tray icon** with Feed / Pet / Pause / Quit
- **Persists state** between launches (`~/.config/tamagotchi/<name>.json` or
  the platform equivalent)
- **Multi-monitor aware** — the pet wanders within the bounds of whichever
  monitor it currently lives on
- **Sprite flipping** when walking left
- **Pixel-art-friendly** — nearest-neighbor 2× scaling, configurable per pet
- **Pet config in YAML** — ship your own pet by adding a folder under `pets/`
- **OpenClaw asset importer** — convert a directory of pre-extracted PNG
  frames into a pet folder ready to run
- **Multiple instances** — run `tamagotchi` twice for two pets

## Quickstart

```sh
git clone https://github.com/katolikov/openclaw-tamagotchi.git
cd openclaw-tamagotchi

python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Linux / Windows
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# macOS — also install the optional PyObjC for true dock-icon hiding
pip install -e ".[dev,macos]"

tamagotchi
```

The default pet is **Claw**, a placeholder pixel-art creature. To bring in
real OpenClaw artwork, see [HOWTO.md](HOWTO.md#importing-openclaw-assets).

## License & inspiration

- Code: MIT
- The placeholder sprite art shipped in `pets/claw/sprites/` is generated by
  `scripts/generate_placeholders.py` and is original — it is **not** ripped
  from *Capt. Claw* or OpenClaw.
- This project does **not** redistribute any OpenClaw assets. The importer
  consumes PNG frames you extract yourself from a copy of the game you own.

Built standing on the shoulders of:
- [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) — the open-source
  *Capt. Claw* re-implementation that inspired the asset-pipeline conventions
- [codex-pets.net](https://codex-pets.net/) — for the pixel-art pet aesthetic
- [PySide6](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython-6/) — the cross-platform GUI bedrock
